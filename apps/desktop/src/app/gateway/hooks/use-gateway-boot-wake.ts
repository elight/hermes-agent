/**
 * Wake recovery for one window's primary gateway socket (#C2a).
 *
 * Extracted from the useGatewayBoot effect: it is the one part of that hook
 * with state of its own (a park latch, a holdoff stamp, the sockets a wake kept
 * alive), and the effect is over its length cap. The host supplies the window's
 * primary and the four things only the hook can do (route resolution,
 * attach/promote, post-connect work, reauth surfacing); everything decided here
 * is decided from renderer-wide stores.
 *
 * Two behaviours live here:
 *
 * 1. PARK. On `visibilitychange → hidden` the window stops paying reconnect
 *    costs: the primary ladder and every pool ladder are disarmed and latched,
 *    and the routes are STALE from then on — the app stops trusting that any
 *    socket survived the time the user was away. Nothing is torn down: the
 *    cached transcript keeps painting and a genuinely alive socket stays up.
 *    A hidden window dials NOTHING, whatever signal arrives (an interface
 *    change, a lid resume that leaves the app backgrounded), which is what
 *    makes a backgrounded app free and a ten-minute background mint zero
 *    tickets.
 *
 * 2. DIAL, DON'T PROBE. On the return — and on online / power-resume — a
 *    socket that still reports OPEN is presumptively dead: the renderer's
 *    WebSocket object keeps `readyState === OPEN` while the OS threw the
 *    transport away, and no close event ever fires. The old path PROBED that
 *    socket with a 5 s ping before deciding, which is strictly slower than the
 *    dial it protects (measured ticket→accept p50 0.02-0.07 s on the test
 *    instance) and left the user watching a dead socket be proven dead. A hard
 *    wake now MINTS AND DIALS a replacement generation at once — while the old
 *    socket stays open, so the window is never un-owned — and retires the old
 *    generation at the earliest safe point:
 *      * nothing was riding it → retire it as soon as the replacement is open;
 *      * a turn was riding it  → keep it (that is #95327: a busy backend must
 *        never have a socket torn out from under a running turn), keep it
 *        SERVED — its listeners live exactly as long as its socket, so the
 *        running turn's deltas on it still reach the app — and retire it once
 *        that turn's claim drains.
 *    The replacement INHERITS the old generation's replay cursors before it
 *    dials: a fresh client that never asks `session.events.since` is a cold
 *    boot, and every event of the half-open window would be lost.
 *    A plain focus is not a hard signal: an alt-tab must never swap a socket
 *    that reports healthy (the #94769 churn class on the primary); it redials
 *    only a primary that is not open.
 *    The liveness probe keeps exactly that #95327 job on the paths that still
 *    need it: the restart-followthrough and the pool's forced sweep.
