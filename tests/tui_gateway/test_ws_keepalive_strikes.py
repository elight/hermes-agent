"""C2a (t_e15288d4): the keepalive strike policy, pinned on the REAL transport.

Step-1 measured (harness, production ``build_listener_server`` on a non-loopback bind): a
client whose process the OS suspends answers no pong, and uvicorn's sansio keepalive kills it
at exactly ``ws_ping_interval + ws_ping_timeout`` — the 20/20 default is the measured 40 s
churn grid. One missed cycle is inconclusive for a backgrounded renderer (the kernel keeps
ACKing; a waking client pongs within milliseconds), so
``hermes_cli/web_server_keepalive.strike_keepalive_protocol`` requires TWO consecutive missed
pongs before the transport's own failure path — and only when that whole budget still fits
under the ~100 s proxy idle cap the non-loopback bind sits behind.

Every scenario is driven through real uvicorn + real ``handle_ws`` (same fixture shape as
``test_ws_close_initiated.py``; that file owns what the kill REPORTS — 1005, no close frame —
this file owns WHEN it fires). ``tests/tui_gateway/test_ws_close_initiated.py`` runs against
plain ``ws="auto"`` and stays the single-strike upstream baseline.
