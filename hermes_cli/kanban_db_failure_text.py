"""``tasks.last_failure_error``: who writes it, and when it still blocks a respawn.

The column has two readers — the board/diagnostics, and
:func:`kanban_db_dispatch.check_respawn_guard`, which parks a card ``blocker_auth``
while the text matches a quota/auth pattern (:func:`blocks_respawn`). So the text
may only describe the card's CURRENT condition: a run that ends in a successful
handoff has worked past whatever stamped it, and leaving the old text behind
parked cards in ``review`` forever once the dispatcher's rate-limit requeue
stamped it and the next run handed off for review (hermes-agent board,
2026-11-13/14).

The write (:func:`retire_superseded_failure`, called from
:func:`kanban_db._end_run`), the read (:func:`blocks_respawn`), and the set both
share (:data:`SUPERSEDING_RUN_OUTCOMES`) live here so they cannot drift apart.
Every other outcome keeps the text live, so a real quota / auth wall still parks
the card. Neither caller loses the failure: the run row and the event log keep it.
